The secret lies in getting the right balance — from the ingredients to the kneading and resting process. Once you master this skill, you’ll realize how satisfying it feels to create something from scratch that fills your kitchen with the aroma of freshly baked bread.",

Room-temperature ingredients ensure smooth batters, while proper oven temperatures prevent cracking. Frosting adds moisture and flavor—buttercream for richness, ganache for elegance. Practice makes perfect, so start with basics and experiment with flavors and fillings."
